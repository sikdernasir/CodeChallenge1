task:
 Find the longest word from a sentence.
 Find the number of the characters in that word.		


Approach :
I have used Java as programming language, Maven as project building tool,TestNG as testing framework, Log4j as logging framework and 
to execute the test, I have created xml suite.
For the Reporting and logging/debugging purpose I have used Log4j and testNG's Reporter to get html report. in log fileAppender,
I have defined txt report.Its a very tiny function to code.not really enough to create a framework. 
I have tried to use these classes and get report from each execution step to make sure they are passed/failed.
